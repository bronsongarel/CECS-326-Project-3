# CECS-326-Project-3

READ ME!!!

NOTE: Project document did not specify if available, max, and alloc matrices should be prompted for user input, we decided to hard code them instead. n,m, and resource request are still prompted.

The code is straightforward to compile and run.

1. Upload code to VSCode
2. Update max, allocation, available matrices if necessary (document test case by defualt)
3. Run the file
4. Enter prompted inputs. For this project, we made n, m, and resource request as inputs. 

The terminal should look like this:

Test case 1:

How many processors do you have? 5
How many resource types do you have? 3
System is in a safe state.
Safe sequence: [1, 3, 0, 2, 4]
Is there a resource request? (y/n): n
no resources requested.
